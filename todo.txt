DONE Add app name at root

DONE Handle ':' in graphviz

***Support multiple routes for one endpoint

DONE sorta Fix routing when parent is more than 1 level up
  This means we don't favour length IF a shorter path matches string wise
  Hmm, this needs something a bit more sophisticated...

  Compromised by using a heuristic matchyness. Exact string match beats a longer placeholder string
  This will probably do strange things in complicated cases

***Better matching of placeholder strings

DONE Perhaps a config file to do heuristics and placeholder matches

DONE Deal with trailing slash absence

DONE Style according to return (page vs data)

DONE Add Get/Post embelishments

***In route objects: add '+' operator to append to path etc

DONE Break into files

***Add configure options for output

***Add legend rather than embedded comment in graph
